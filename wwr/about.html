            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Whitewater Rafting wasn't born overnight. It was the culmination of a dream held by a group of passionate river enthusiasts. 
             In the heart of Waterloo, a group of friends, united by their love for the wild, decided to share their passion with the world.
             It all began in 2010, when Robert, a seasoned river guide, and Jorge, an experienced outdoor enthusiast, joined forces. 
             With a shared vision of providing thrilling and unforgettable whitewater adventures, they set out to establish a company that 
             would become synonymous with adrenaline and nature.
             Over the years, [Your Company Name] has grown from a small, local operation to a renowned name in the adventure tourism industry. 
             We've expanded our offerings, added new rivers to our roster, and invested in state-of-the-art equipment and safety protocols.
             Today, we're proud to be more than just a rafting company. We're a community of adventure seekers who share a deep respect for 
             the environment and a commitment to providing exceptional experiences.</p>
